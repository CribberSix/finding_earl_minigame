      \n 'info' - shows some information about the game
      \n 'look' - shows what the character can see
      \n 'inspect' - shows more details on a specific object
      \n 'i' or 'inventory' - shows the inventory
      \n 'take' - takes an object to inventory
      \n 'drop' - drops an object to the floor
      \n 'go' or 'walk' - let's you move around. Acceptable directions are: north\\forward, west\\right, south\\backward, east\\left

      \n\nThe algorithm tries to match the input's first word - needs to be a <verb> - to a game functionality.
      \nCertain verbs require further input, for example what the <object> of the verb is. Some verbs
      work without further input and may even ignore further input.
      \n\nThe parser will tell you if he does not know a verb or if he needs further information, so
      the best thing to do is to try it out!
