# Testfile

this is a test

- Type Hints, for code completion (and to help you make the squiggly lines disappear) in editors and IDEs.
- Code cleanup, using lots of code robustness tools like static analyzers, and automated CI/CD. We've been able to help dozens of people new to community projects contribute. We have lots of work to go on code quality, but we're currently the highest rated Python and highest rate C large project on LGTM.
- Many, many bug fixes including in our pygame.draw routines, pygame.math(for vectors), and pygame.mask for pixel perfect collision detection.
better support for PyPy (the fast JIT based implementation of python). See our milestone Are we pypy yet? No. for our progress on making PyPy the best python for games.
- libsdl version 2 support. Technically pygame 2.0 still works with SDL 1, but we recommend SDL2 which is vastly improved over SDL1 for most use cases. Probably we will remove SDL 1 support starting pygame 2.1.
